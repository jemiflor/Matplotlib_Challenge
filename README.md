## Observations and Insights 


> - Capomulin and Ramicane treatments treated mouses with less tumor size. We should check how other treatements respond when the mouse tumor size is less. From the given data for now Capomulin is effective and treatments tends to peform well when the tumor size is low initally
> - Weight of the mouse is almost 84% strongly reated to the tumor size. We should study if the mouse age is a factor
> - Capomulin and Ramicane the top 2 promissed treatments also made more observations than the other treatments but less number of mice were included for the trial. We should conduct a study across the treatments with same control parameters (number of mice, similar tumor size across the treatments and observe. But with the given data and the spread we infer Capomulin is more effective
